# Payment-Libraries

## Welcome to our GitHub. 

These are our Library files for interfacing with the payment API. For your convenience we have added sample codes that you can use and tweak in order to get a headstart on coding to our API. Each source code has our most functional calls to make a successful payment, gather reports, and create customers.

## How to use our API?

1. Reference our developer pages at developer.mxmerchant.com
2. Choose any sample library of your coding choice, (C#, Javascript, PHP, etc)
3. Utilize the combination of our sample codes and our developer documentation to make test calls.
